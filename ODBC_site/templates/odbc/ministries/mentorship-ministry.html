                        The last baptism class held in November 2013 was one of the largest baptism classes 
                        we have had at Open Door. Many of them were new converts who needed guidance and support. 
                        In order to meet this need of constant support and follow up, each baptism candidate was assigned 
                        a mentor from Open Door Believers Chapel–a big brother and a big sister in Christ.

                        Each big sister and brother is encouraged to check up on their little sister or little brother 
                        and to encourage them in their growth in their knowledge of Christ. The mentorship program 
                        is also about developing relationships with one another through devotion, care and encouraging 
                        each other in our daily walk and transformation. A big sister or brother’s mentorship manifests 
                        in the way they live—it is evident to others. The experiences they share can lead someone to 
                        share in the love of grace of Jesus Christ. Being a mentor takes commitment, a passion, 
                        and an understanding of the Word of God, and it is not an option for believers but a command.
