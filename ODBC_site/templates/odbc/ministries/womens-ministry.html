                        The Sisters Ministry of ODBC started soon after the church was established with a 
                        Retreat for Ladies of the church in Camalote, Cayo. This retreat has become the 
                        highlight of the year as it is now eagerly anticipated by the Ladies of ODBC and 
                        others from as far south as Punta Gorda and as far north as Corozal. The retreat 
                        has become an interdenominational affair as ladies from other churches also attend 
                        and have been doing so for many years. One should not be fooled by the word ‘ladies’ the 
                        retreat is inclusive of all females of any age. Actually this is one of the distinguishing 
                        features of the retreat-an intermingling of the generations of women. At the last retreat, 
                        held in October 2012, there were many examples of three generations of women present – Remarkable.

                        The Sisters Ministry is designed to create fellowship, bond and support for all the ladies at ODBC. 
                        The Ministry is led by the Ladies Committee, a dynamic team which still boasts three of its original members.

                        The annual retreat is just one of the many events organized by the Ladies Ministry. 
                        The Annual Valentine affair which evolved from a social to an exquisite banquet 
                        is another exciting activity which involves all members of the church. No special 
                        Valentine on Valentines’ day? No problem, there is always the ODBC banquet to attend 
                        which makes everyone feel special and remind us of the ultimate display of love 
                        through our Saviour, Jesus Christ.
